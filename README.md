```
Doo, doo, doo, doo-roo
I just can't help falling in love with you

Wise men say, "Only fools rush in"
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay? (Shall I stay?) Would it be a sin (be a sin)
If I can't help falling in love with you?

Like a river flows to the sea
So it goes, some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand (take my hand), take my whole life too (whole life too)
For I can't help falling in love with you

Wise men say, "Only fools rush in"
But I, I can't, I can't help falling in love with you (falling in love with you)

Like a river flows to the sea
So it goes, some things are meant to be
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand (take my hand), take my whole life too (whole life too)
For I can't help falling in love with you

Take my hand (take my hand), take my whole life too (whole life too)
For I can't help falling in love with you (falling in love with you)
For I can't help falling in love, falling in love with you

Like a river flows, that's the way it goes
I just can't help falling in love with you (falling in love with you)
Like a river flows (take my hand), that's the way it goes (my whole life too)
I just can't help it, falling in love with you

Like a river flows (take my hand), that's the way it goes
I just can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows (take my hand), that's the way it goes ('cause I can't help)
I just can't help it, falling in love with you
